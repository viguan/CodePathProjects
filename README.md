# Pre-work - *tippy*

**tippy** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Vicky Guan**

Time spent: **7** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [x] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Including a bill splitting option for more than one person
- [x] Including a statement that indicates how many persons are chosen for bill splitting
- [x] Including a background that works with parallax motion when using a physical device

## Notes

It was kind of difficult to initially understand how everything works together. At least I have some prior Android development experience, and so
learning things was not terribly bad. I'm super excited to work on the other apps when the time comes!
